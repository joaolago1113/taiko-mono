# Taiko docs

Welcome to Taiko docs!

## Repo architecture

Here we will list the important folders within this repo.

### src/content

This is where we store all of the content.

### src/content/config.ts

This is where we extend the `docsSchema`.

## Development Setup

To set up the project for local development, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have all necessary dependencies installed.
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

2. **Start the Development Server**: Run the development server to view the docs locally.
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

The development server will start, and you can view the documentation site locally at `http://localhost:4321/`.
